This requires a certain level of vulnerability and trust, which I hope that we can establish together.\nUltimately, I designed this course around three pedogogical commitments:\n\nDemocratic Education: Promote a learning community that (cite Friere, Pedagogy of Heart).\nPluralist Learning: Engage with, relate to, and communicate with individuals and communities (Simmer-Brown, )\nLoving Corrections (cite amb, 2024)\n\n\nDemocratic Education\n\n\nPluralist Learning\n\n\nLoving Corrections\nLoving Corrections is a two-part concept intended to build community and acheive more just futures (link book).\n\nPrimarily, the Loving aspect refers to building movements and coalitions that are expansive enough to “invite the world into the future” (p. 7)\nThe Corrections piece argues that to build these expansive coalitions, “we cannot cancel other living beings from the world”. Rather, we should search for “dignified ways of being in communities that face, address, and evolve beyond harmful patterns”\n\nIn some ways this requires us to “accept that each of us has some responsibility for holding the massive changes needed for survival”, and ask, “how do we hold each other close enough for our hardest lessons? (p5)”\n\nLoving Corrections is for “those who want to be solution-oriented, but who can get sucked into deconstruction and judgment that destroys others, rather than destroying the toxic concepts that ‘go viral’ among us”\nask yourself, how can I invite my peers into belonging?\nhow can we “create conditions that support dignity for each person, and stop confusing identity for community?”\nhow can we “[build] and [sustain] communities that can survive and create more possibilities together?”\nhow can [challenge] regressive policies and beliefs that separate us, reminding our species that we belong to this earth and to each other”?\nhow can we “honestly [engage] in community as students of belonging?”\n\n\n\nShared Expectations\nNote that this will be completed during our first class session, more to come, soon!",

Please come ready to discuss the case study and apply theoretical findings.\nFridays will be spent primarily on an in-class data visualization exercise related to the weekly case study. Please review the exercise before class, and be ready to work in rotating pairs on the assignment, and submit it individually by the following Monday at 11:59 PM. Note that the assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped (i.e., 6 of 7 assignments, each counting for 10% of your grade).\n\n\nCommunity Case Study Final Project (30%): End of semester individual project on a community case study of your choice. Note that final project score is cumulative, including a mid-semester check-in and proposed data visualization strategy (10%) and final submission (20%).\n\n\n\n\nCourse Readings\nThere are no textbooks for this course. All course readings will be made available on the website. Please see the schedule for each week’s corresponding material.\n\n\nCommunication\nClass emails will be sent out via Brightspace. Please do feel free to email me with questions or concerns regarding the course, and I will do my best to respond within 24 hours (excluding weekends).\n\n\nAccessibility and Disability\nEvery student has the right to full access in this course. If you find any material difficulty to access due to course format, technology, or any other reason, please don’t hesitate to let me know so that we can identify appropriate accommodations.\nAdditionally, the Wellesley Office of Accessibility and Disability Resources (ADR) ensures that students receive reasonable and appropriate accommodations including but not limited to: testing accommodations, classroom accommodations, notetaking services, on-campus transportation, communication resources, and assistive technology. In the case that you require accommodations, please be in touch with ADR to request or update an accommodation letter.\n\n\nReligious Observance\nStudents observing a religious holiday that conflicts with a scheduled course event are encouraged to speak with me in advance to identify alternative arrangements. Students are also welcome to read more about the College’s Policy on National Holidays and Religious Days of Observance, or submit a Religious Observance Notification Form.\n\n\nDiscrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct\nWellesley College considers diversity essential to educational excellence, and we are committed to being a community in which each member thrives. The College does not allow discrimination or harassment based on race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ethnic or national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, pregnancy or any other protected status under applicable local, state or federal law.\nIf you or someone you know has experienced discrimination or harassment, support is available to you:\nConfidential Reporting: Students can report their experiences to Health Services (781-283-2810); Stone Center Counseling Service (781-283-2839); or Religious and Spiritual Life (781-283-2685). These offices are not required to report allegations of sexual misconduct to the College.\nNon-Confidential Reporting: You can let your instructor know. As faculty, we are obligated to report allegations of sex-based discrimination to the Non-discrimination/Title IX Office. You can report directly to the Non-discrimination/Title IX Office (781-283-2451) to receive support, and to learn more about your options for a response by the College or about reporting to a different institution. You can report to the Wellesley College Police Department (Emergency: 781-283-5555, Non-emergency: 781-283-2121) if you believe a crime has been committed, or if there is an immediate safety risk.\n\n\nFeedback\nI sincerely care about your experience in this course, and am always interested to hear your feedback. There are several ways to share your ideas and suggestions:\n\nCome talk to me! I know that students are likely to have different learning styles, which means I won’t be offended if you share ideas on how to improve things.\nYou can always provide feedback anonymously via this form\nI’ll also collect anonymous feedback about the course at the mid-semester point.",

    "text": "In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach (i.e., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and disability) and their applications to environmental injustice.\nAssess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus).\nIdentify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice (procedural, recognitional, and restorative justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.",

For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.",
