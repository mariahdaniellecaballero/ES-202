    "text": "In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach (i.e., how systems of power can reinforce oppression of land and people) and their applications to environmental injustice.\nReflect on how your positionality and lived experiences shape your approach to environmental justice.\nAssess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus).\nIdentify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice (procedural, recognitional, restorative, and cosmopolitan justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.\nSuggest opportunities for intervention by developing a theory-driven logic model.",

This requires a certain level of vulnerability and trust, which I hope that we can establish together.\nI also designed this course to help students foster community beyond the classroom, so that they too can go on to build expansive, solution-oriented movements that welcome everyone into a collective vision of what the world could be. I share some of adrienne marie brown’s 1 points on social justice and community, that may be useful to ask of yourself and others throughout this course:\n\nHow can we invite our peers into belonging?\nHow can we create conditions that ensure dignity for each person?\nHow can we challenge regressive beliefs meant to divide us, and remind one another that we belong to this planet, and each other?\nHow can we forge communities that not only survive, but can imagine more equitable realities?\n\n\n\nShared Expectations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis section will be completed during our first class session, more to come, soon!",

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nLate Policy\nBecause we start homework assignments in class, and material is cumulative, it’s very important that readings and assignments are completed by the deadlines they are designed for. Because of this, work submitted after the deadline will be accepted; however there will be a 10% deduction per day that the assignment is late. Late work will not be accepted for the final group project, or any of its checkpoints.\nIf you anticipate an assignment will be late due to an emergency, please email me at least 24 hours before the due date to discuss a path forward. In collaboration with your class dean and/or health services, we will figure out the best path forward, together.\nIf you know you will need to miss class due to illness or family emergency, please let me know so we can make a plan for how to proceed.\n\n\nUse of Generative AI\nIn addition to the overwhelming energy and water use that data centers use to answer your queries (a distributional burden that communities like my hometown are now bearing 2), generative AI poses significant threats to the core of this class. I designed this course to 1) stretch students’ abilities to comprehend and apply justice-based theories, and 2) learn the foundations of data visualization in R. Therefore, I ask that you do not use it for the following:\n\nSummarizing or annoting readings\nGenerating code of any kind\nAnswering any questions on assignments\n\nIf you feel that generative AI can be used to improve your knowledge on a topic, or for brainstorming ideas without sacrificing your ability to think critically, please come speak with me about it, before you employ it in your workflow. I’m still learning the pros and cons of Generative AI in higher education, and I always welcome the discussion.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nCourse Components\n\nAttendance and Participation (10%): This primarily includes coming to class prepared (i.e., completed any preparatory readings/assignments before our scheduled course meeting), engaging with peers on course content (i.e., asking questions, sharing thoughts and ideas, participating in group activities).\nPositionality Statement (5%): The first assignment for the course will be a brief statement that explains your positionality and how it might influence your engagement with the course and its materials.\nWeekly Assignments (60%): Each week provides an opportunity to discuss and explore different forms of environmental justice through a community case study.\n\nTuesdays will focus on small and large-group discussions on key theoretical concepts related to that week’s community case study. Please come prepared to discuss the readings.\nFridays will mainly focus on an in-class data visualization exercise (each worth 10%) related to the weekly case study. Please read the assigned case study and review the exercise before class. Be prepared to work in rotating pairs on the assignment, then submit it individually by the following Thursday at 11:59 PM.\n\nCommunity Case Study Final Project (25%): End of semester group project on a community case study of your choice. Note that final project score is cumulative, including a project proposal (5%), project plan (10%), and final submission (10%). Please see the Final Project Discription for more information.\n\n\n\nLetter Grades\nCourse Grade percentages are calculated into letter grades using the following table\n\n\n\nPercentage\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n&gt;= 95\nA\n\n\n&gt;= 90\nA-\n\n\n&gt;= 87\nB+\n\n\n&gt;= 85\nB\n\n\n&gt;= 80\nB-\n\n\n&gt;= 77\nC+\n\n\n&gt;= 75\nC\n\n\n&gt;= 70\nC -\n\n\n&gt;= 60\nD\n\n\n&lt; 60\nF\n\n\n\nPlease note that the minimum grade to earn credit under credit/no credit grading is a C. The minimum grade to pass and earn credit under normal letter grading is a D. You’re welcome to read more about Wellesley’s grading policies here.\n\n\nCourse Readings\nThere are no textbooks for this course. All course readings will be made available on the website. Please see the schedule for each week’s corresponding material.\n\n\nCommunication\nClass emails will be sent out via Brightspace. Please do feel free to email me with questions or concerns regarding the course, and I will do my best to respond within 48 hours (excluding weekends).\n\n\nAccessibility and Disability\nEvery student has the right to full access in this course. If you find any material difficulty to access due to course format, technology, or any other reason, please don’t hesitate to let me know so that we can identify appropriate accommodations.\nAdditionally, the Wellesley Office of Accessibility and Disability Resources (ADR) ensures that students receive reasonable and appropriate accommodations including but not limited to: testing accommodations, classroom accommodations, notetaking services, on-campus transportation, communication resources, and assistive technology. In the case that you require accommodations, please be in touch with ADR to request or update an accommodation letter.\n\n\nReligious Observance\nStudents observing a religious holiday that conflicts with a scheduled course event are encouraged to speak with me in advance to identify alternative arrangements. Students are also welcome to read more about the College’s Policy on National Holidays and Religious Days of Observance, or submit a Religious Observance Notification Form.\n\n\nDiscrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct\nWellesley College considers diversity essential to educational excellence, and we are committed to being a community in which each member thrives. The College does not allow discrimination or harassment based on race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ethnic or national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, pregnancy or any other protected status under applicable local, state or federal law.\nIf you or someone you know has experienced discrimination or harassment, support is available to you:\nConfidential Reporting: Students can report their experiences to Health Services (781-283-2810); Stone Center Counseling Service (781-283-2839); or Religious and Spiritual Life (781-283-2685). These offices are not required to report allegations of sexual misconduct to the College.\nNon-Confidential Reporting: You can let your instructor know. As faculty, we are obligated to report allegations of sex-based discrimination to the Non-discrimination/Title IX Office. You can report directly to the Non-discrimination/Title IX Office (781-283-2451) to receive support, and to learn more about your options for a response by the College or about reporting to a different institution. You can report to the Wellesley College Police Department (Emergency: 781-283-5555, Non-emergency: 781-283-2121) if you believe a crime has been committed, or if there is an immediate safety risk.\n\n\nFeedback\nI sincerely care about your experience in this course, and am always interested to hear your feedback.

Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.",

For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner.

In other words, we are “forging a learning community that values wholeness over division, dissociation, [and] splitting”. 2 Additionally, in academia, it is common to share your positionality as part of the research process. In doing so, you’re acknowledging that you exist within a larger social fabric, and that you can reflexively analyze your own work."

In other words, we are “forging a learning community that values wholeness over division, dissociation, [and] splitting”. 2 Additionally, in academia, it is common to share your positionality as part of the research process. In doing so, you’re acknowledging that you exist within a larger social fabric, and that you can reflexively analyze your own work."

    "text": "My name is Mariah Caballero. I am the proud daughter of two elementary educators: a Mexican American father and a white mother. My mixed heritage, cultures, and family often mean that I exist liminally in both. At times, I see my heritage and cultures at odds in my community and family. I grew up as a third-generation member in rural eastern Washington. My community is predominantly Latine and depends on industrial agriculture to support its economy, an unequal relationship that began far before my grandparents immigrated to the States. I am the first in my family to receive my PhD, and I am beginning my career as an assistant professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College.\nMy upbringing was centered on education. From an early age, my parents taught me that in addition to upward mobility, education can be liberatory and can serve your community. In my research and teaching, I strive to embody the latter. I’ve also witnessed the role that intersecting systems of oppression play within my own family. For example, white supremacy unequally benefits some of my family members (myself included), while harming others. At the same time, I recognize that I am the product of two people who continue to choose dignity, belonging, and love for one another over divisiveness. Given my lived experiences, I strive to create a learning environment committed to individual and community growth, so that we all might be better suited to challenge regressive policies and identity-based beliefs that separate us."

    "text": "The final group project is intended to assess your theoretical and methodological skills in environmental justice. Teams are tasked with creating a multimedia narrative of one environmental justice theme (food, energy, water, waste, or climate) based on a community case study of their choice. Final project reports should include both a visual and narrative component:\n\nVisual Component: Use data to demonstrate environmental injustice occurring in a community of your choice using at least three data visualizations\nNarrative Component: Provide background information on the community of interest, apply two or more theoretical tenets of justice to describe an unjust process, and propose a more equitable intervention using a basic logic model (1500 words)"

    "section": "Team Selection",
    "text": "Team Selection\nTeams will be based on a combination of 1) anonymous student preferences for teammates (complementary disciplinary strengths and experiences, and coordinating schedules) and 2) my discretion. Teams will comprise 2-3 people.\nAlthough working in groups can be challenging, it is also a critical component of interdisciplinary research– we cannot know everything, and often, it makes far more sense to lean on others’ expertise. Moreover, team-based work is a critical component of organizing for Environmental Justice. To help support team-based work, I will provide time throughout the course to work on final projects and groups will receive feedback from peers."
