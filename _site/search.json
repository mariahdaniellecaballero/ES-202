Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies.

I loved the small class sizes, relationships that I built with professors, and the opportunity to learn in creative, different ways. Because of this, I hope that students not only take away the skills associated with the course’s measurable outcomes, but also learn more about themselves, their peers, and the environment around them. This requires a certain level of vulnerability and trust, which I hope that we can establish together.\nUltimately, I designed this course around three pedogogical commitments:\n\nDemocratic Education: Promote a learning community that (cite Friere, Pedagogy of Heart).\nPluralist Learning: Engage with, relate to, and communicate with individuals and communities (Simmer-Brown, )\nLoving Corrections (cite amb, 2024)\n\nI want you to stop by Office Hours (E152)\nI get Overwhelmed by the Climate Crisis, too\n\n\nTeaching, Learning, and Being in Community\n\nDemocratic Education\n\n\nPluralist Learning\n\n\nLoving Corrections\n\n\nShared Expectations\nNote that this will be completed during our first class session, more to come, soon!",

For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.",
