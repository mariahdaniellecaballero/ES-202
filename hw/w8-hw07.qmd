## Overview 
This case study uses annual solar energy potential data from the National Renewable Energy Lab's [National Solar Radiation Data Base](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar-resource-maps) and energy burden data from the Department of Energy's [Low-Income Energy Affodability Data Tool](https://www.energy.gov/scep/slsc/lead-tool), and connecting it back to foundational theoretical aspects of recognition justice.
