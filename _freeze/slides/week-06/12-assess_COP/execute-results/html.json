We most frequently will use scales to:\n  - change axis ticks \n  - add color palettes to your plots\n- Perhaps we were interested in how the number of party delegates has changed over time for AOSIS and non-AOSIS countries. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nannual_parties <- parties |>\n  group_by(Year, AOSIS) |>\n  count()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Scales(cont.) {.smaller}\n- Let's start with a basic line graph. \n  - How are the axes looking? \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nannual_parties |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = n, color = AOSIS))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-assess_COP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scales (Axes ticks/labels) {.smaller}\n- `scale_x_continuous()` allows you to change your x axis visuals.

The goal is to generate questions and explore your data to decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make. \n- There are lots of ways to explore your data, but let's learn three ways based on our variable types\n  - one continuous \n  - one categorical and one continuous\n  - two categorical\n\n## One Continuous Variable {.smaller}\n- Let's create a subset of our data for COP27 delegates, and count the number of delegates per country. \n- `geom_histogram()` gives us a great look at variation in a variable.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncop_27 <- parties |>\n  filter(Year == 2022) |>\n  count(AOSIS, Delegation)\n\n# plot\ncop_27 |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Histogram {.smaller}\n- Any important variation among delegate counts?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Using the `delegate_size` dataframe, filter out the outlying delegate numbers (i.e., n <1000) and visualize the variation in party size between AOSIS and Non-AOSIS countries using a boxplot. \n\n2. Using the results from the previous question, what sort of variation do you see in delegation size between AOSIS and non-AOSIS countries? \n  - Here's a [quick explanation](https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html) of boxplots in case it's been awhile. :-) \n\n\n## Data Visualization Options\nNow that we know how to format figures and explore variation in our data, we can think about how we might want to use our data to tell a story. \n\nHere are some great resources that I use often for inspiration. \n\n## From Data to Viz {.smaller}\n- [This is a great visual](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aA_tWldPtM-wmbZvVYsOIF14Iec4bZmA?usp=drive_link) I often use when I'm thinking about the kinds of variables I have (or could create). \n![alt](images/poster-big.png)\n\n## Example Workflow \n- Say I'm interested in the number of delegates from universities or colleges in COP attendance, and their affiliated country, between 1995 and 2024. \n- If I filter the data and create a summarized dataframe, I'll have: \n  - one categorical and several numeric variables, one of which is ordered (aka, year). \n  - I think a grouped line plot could be good here. \n\n## Summarizing my data {.smaller}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhigher_ed <- cop_delegates |>\n  filter(str_detect(Affiliation, \"University\") | \n           str_detect(Affiliation, \"College\")) |> \n  group_by(Year, AOSIS) |>\n  count()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## R Graph Gallery {.smaller}\n- Once I choose a visual I'm interested in, I often use the website [r-graph-gallery.com](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) to find base code for kind of visual I'm interested in creating. \n- I'll select the \"line graph\" icon and find example code that creates a graphic I like. \n- Lastly, I can set a theme using the `ggethemr` package, let's use one called \"light\". \n  - You can see more palette options, [here](https://github.com/Mikata-Project/ggthemr)!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggthemr(\"solarized\")\n\nhigher_ed %>%\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_line(aes(x=Year, y=n, group=AOSIS, color=AOSIS))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Not bad! {.smaller}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n‚Ñπ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggthemr package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_rect()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n‚Ñπ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggthemr package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The `scale_name` argument of `discrete_scale()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n3.5.0.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-assess_COP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## GGplot2 Cheatsheet {.smaller}\n- Lastly, once I have the base plot that I like, I'll use the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html) to change small things that require code I haven't committed to memory, like axes labels, themes, etc. \n\n## Ta da! {.smaller}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhigher_ed |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = n, group = AOSIS, color = AOSIS),\n    linewidth = 1.5\n  ) +\n  labs(y = \"Number of Higher Ed Delegates\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2025, by = 5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 3000, by = 500),\n    labels = label_comma()\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-assess_COP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## EX_03 + EX_04: \n  - See Posit! \n\n## Logistics \n- No class Tuesday, Happy Fall Break! \n- Dr. Caballero to lead centering on Friday\n- Logic model discussion next Friday",
