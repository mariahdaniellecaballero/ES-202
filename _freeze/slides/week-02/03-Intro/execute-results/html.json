Residential decarbonization also provides an opportunity for energy justice, where communities that have been previously disinvested in can be prioritized-- promoting healthier homes and more affordable energy bills. While significant research has been dedicated to decarbonizing homes in urban locations, very little research has been conducted on the challenges and opportunities for decarbonizing rural housing stock. This project will oversee three students on one interdisciplinary research project with multiple collaborators (Dr. Dan Sambor at Olin College and the Clean Energy Transition Institute in Seattle, WA) and research outcomes\n\n## Dr. Selden's Project: {.smaller}\n| **Title:** Mapping Fishing Communities' Economic and Cultural Ties to Offshore Locations to Enhance Participation in Management and Decision-making\n| **Description:** The seascape is an increasingly crowded place, and effective ocean management requires an understanding of the importance of ocean areas for fisheries, conservation, marine transportation, and marine-based renewable energy. We seek to make visible the relationship of fishing communities to offshore locations to enhance their participation in ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning. To do so, this project will integrate quantitative spatial information from a thirty-year database of vessel trip records of Northeast US fishing communities with qualitiative analysis of existing oral histories.\n\n## Application \n- Deadline: February 6, 2026, at 11 PM EST\n- [Link to Application](https://intranet.wellesley.edu/administrative/science-center/for-students/research-and-funding-opportunities/summer-research-program)\n\n## Last Class \n![](./images/mind_map.png)\n\n# \n![](./images/intersectional_Ej_fig.png)\n\n## What we Read {.smaller}\n- Murdock, E.
