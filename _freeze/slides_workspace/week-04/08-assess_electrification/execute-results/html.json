activity\n- Setting the stage\n- Zoom with Dr. Harrison\n- Paired coding\n- Group Debrief\n\n# Centering Activity\nEmily :-)\n\n# Setting the Stage\n- This week's focus is on coding style and data tidying\n- Using data from the 1934 Rural Electrification Surveys provided by Dr. Conor Harrison\n\n## Zoom with Dr. Harrison\n- Join using [link](https://wellesley.zoom.us/j/94645455904?jst=2) in slides, or in week 04 of schedule. \n- Please mute yourself, so there's no echoing. \n- Feel free to ask questions (unmute then)!\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n- Understand coding style best practices\n- Read accompanying data documentation and understand data summaries\n- New skills in data tidying (i.e., lengthening and widening data)\n- Connect findings to theoretical understandings of restorative justice\n\n# Let's get Started\n- Find your pair\n- Open Posit\n\n## Load Packages\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Coding Style Best Practices\n\n## Naming Dataframes {.smaller}\n- Naming conventions are a matter of preference, but readability is key.\n  - R4ds suggests using lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only. \n  - longer, more informative names are usually beter than short, confusing names.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# strive for\nsurvey <- read_excel(\"data/survey_edgecombe.xlsx\", \n  sheet = \"Survey\")\n  \ndictionary <- read_excel(\"data/survey_edgecombe.xlsx\", \n    sheet = \"Dictionary\")\n\n# avoid\nEDGECOMBESRVY1934 <- read_excel(\"data/survey_edgecombe.xlsx\", sheet = \"Survey\")\n\nrm(EDGECOMBESRVY1934)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Spaces\n- Spaces should go on both sides of operators (-, +, >, etc.), except for ^.\n- parentheses do not need spaces around them. \n- use a space after a comma, like English. :-) \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# strive for\nmean(survey$HOGS)\n\n# avoid\nmean (survey$HOGS)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Pipes\n- Pipes should have a space before them and should be the last part of a line. \n- After a pipe, the next line should be indented two spaces (RStudio will automatically do this for you if you end your line with a pipe).  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# strive for\nsurvey |>\n  filter(TENURE == \"Tenant\") |>\n  count(WAFFLE_IRON)\n\n# avoid\nsurvey|>filter(TENURE == \"Tenant\")|>count(WAFFLE_IRON)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## ggplot{.smaller}\n- ggplot functions just like pipes (i.e., each new layer should end with a +)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvey |>\n  filter(RACE != \"Unknown\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(KWH_YEAR, BILL_ANNUAL, color = RACE)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08-assess_electrification_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise One (collaborative)\nRestyle the following code chunks (in the empty chunk below) and label what each line is doing, using \"#\". \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvey|>filter(TENURE%in%c(\"Owner\",\"Tenant\")& RACE %in%c(\"Black\", \"White\"))|>group_by(TENURE,RACE)|>summarize(n=n(),mean_cows =mean(DAIRY_COW), mean_fruit=mean(FRUIT_ACRE))\n\nsurvey|>filter(LINE %in%c(18,20,22,15)&RACE == \"Black\")|>group_by(TENURE)|>summarise(avg_hens=mean(HENS))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Data Documentation\n\n## Reading a Data Dictionary {.smaller}\n- Data dictionaries offer descriptions of your dataframe that otherwise cannot be included in tidy data. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(dictionary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 71\nColumns: 3\n$ `Column Name` <chr> \"LINE\", \"USER_NAME\", \"COND_PREMISES_RC\", \"RATE_INTER_RC\"‚Ä¶\n$ Definition    <chr> \"Proposed Line Number\", \"Name of Proposed User (Last, Fi‚Ä¶\n$ Origin        <chr> \"Original Data\", \"Original Data\", \"Created\", \"Created\", ‚Ä¶\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data Summaries \n- The `summary` function provides a great opportunity to view and understand important aspects of your data. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(survey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   USER_ID           USER_NUMBER         LINE        USER_NAME        \n

results of the `survey` dataframe, choose five variables and tell me: \n\n1) the variable name\n2) its definition \n3) its data type\n4) whether there are any NA values (if it's numeric). \n\n# Lengthening and Widening Data {.smaller}\n\n\n## Lengthening Data {.smaller}\n- Suppose we were interested in reshaping a dataframe we created called `animals` into a new dataframe called `animals_long`. We would use the `pivot_longer()` function and supply the following arguments: \n  - `cols` are the columns we want to pivot, in this case, all of the columns between `DAIRY_COW ` and `HOGS`\n  - `names_to` is the new column name that we want the column *names* we selected in the `cols` function to go into. In this case, we will call it `animal`. \n  - `values_to` is the new column name that we want the column *values* to go into. In this case, we will call it \"count\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanimals <- survey |>\n  select(USER_NAME, DAIRY_COW:HOGS)\n\nanimals_long <- animals |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = DAIRY_COW:HOGS,\n    names_to = \"animal\",\n    values_to = \"count\"\n  )\n\nanimals_long\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Lengthening Data (cont.) {.smaller}\n![](images/lengthen.png)\n\n## Widening Data {.smaller}\n- Suppose we were interested in reshaping the long dataframe we created called `animals_long` into our original dataframe called `animals`.

In this case, it's the `animal` column. \n  - `values_from` is the column with the *values* that we want to now be distributed across the column names.
