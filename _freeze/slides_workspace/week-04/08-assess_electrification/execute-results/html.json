Compare average ratings for condition of the premise and interview quality by race and tenure. Remove data inputs with \"Unknown\" listed for race or tenure, and format the table nicely. \n\n2. Based on your findings, describe the role that rating the condition of the premise and interview quality played in determining the correction factor. \n\n3. Calculate the following for race and tenure. Remove data inputs with \"Unknown\" listed for race or tenure, and format the table nicely. \n  1. Average uncorrected annual energy usage\n  2. Average corrected annual energy usage\n  3. Average bill\n  4. Average cost per Kwh\n\n4. Based on your findings, describe the role that rating the condition of the premise and interview quality played in determining the correction factor. How did this state-sanctioned process shape the energy landscape in Edgecombe County that may have lasting effects today? \n\n5. Reflect on your findings and connect them to our readings on distributional justice AND restorative justice. \n\n*Bonus:* Using the dataframe and data dictionary, compare patterns in a variable of your choice (i.e., owns a waffle iron, owns x number of hogs), and compare disparities among tenure and race. Remember to remove data inputs with \"Unknown\" listed for race or tenure, and format the table nicely. ",
