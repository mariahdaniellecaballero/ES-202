## Course Description

In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach** (i.e., race, ethnicity,  gender, sexuality, class, and disability) and their applications to environmental injustice.
2. **Reflect on how your positionality and lived experiences** shape your approach to environmental justice. 
3. **Assess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities** related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus). 
4. **Identify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice** (procedural, recognitional, restorative, and cosmopolitan justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.
5. **Suggest opportunities for intervention** by developing a theory-driven logic model.
