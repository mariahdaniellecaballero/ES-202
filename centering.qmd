title: "Centering Activity Sign-Up"
---

## Overview
Life is busy, and we often have millions of things on our minds. Centering activities are brief activities (< 5 minutes) meant to bring everyone into the present. Students are in charge of leading a centering activity before each class. 

- This could beâ€¦
    - A breathing exercise
    - A silly doodle
    - A journaling activity
    - Reading your favorite poem
    - Sharing your favorite new song
