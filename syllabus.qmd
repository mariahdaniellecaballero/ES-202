## Goals and Expectations
### Course Description
In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach** (i.e., race, ethnicity,  gender, sexuality, class, and disability) and their applications to environmental injustice.
2. **Assess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities** related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus). 
3. **Identify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice** (procedural, recognitional, and restorative justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.


## Course Community
### Teaching, Learning, and Being in Community
I hope that students not only take away the skills associated with the course's measurable outcomes, but also learn more about themselves, their peers, and the environment around them. This requires a certain level of vulnerability and trust, which I hope that we can establish together. 

Ultimately, I designed this course around three pedogogical commitments:

-  *Democratic Education:* Promote a learning community that (cite Friere, Pedagogy of Heart).
- *Pluralist Learning:* Engage with, relate to, and communicate with individuals and communities (Simmer-Brown, )
-  *Loving Corrections* (cite amb, 2024)

#### Democratic Education

#### Pluralist Learning

#### Loving Corrections
*Loving Corrections* is a two-part concept intended to build community and acheive more just futures (link book). 

- Primarily, the *Loving* aspect refers to  building movements and coalitions that are expansive enough to "invite the world into the future" (p. 7)
- The Corrections piece argues that to build these expansive coalitions, "we cannot cancel other living beings from the world". Rather, we should search for "dignified ways of being in communities that face, address, and evolve beyond harmful patterns"
    - In some ways this requires us to "accept that each of us has some responsibility for holding the massive changes needed for survival", and ask, "how do we hold each other close enough for our hardest lessons? (p5)"
- *Loving Corrections* is for "those who want to be solution-oriented, but who can get sucked into deconstruction and judgment that destroys others, rather than destroying the toxic concepts that 'go viral' among us"

- *ask* yourself, how can I invite my peers into belonging? 
- how can we "create conditions that support dignity for each person, and stop confusing identity for community?"
- how can we "[build] and [sustain] communities that can survive and create more possibilities together?"
- how can [challenge] regressive policies and beliefs that separate us, reminding our species that we belong to this earth and to each other"?
- how can we "honestly [engage] in community as students of belonging?"


#### Shared Expectations
*Note that this will be completed during our first class session, more to come, soon!*

## Course Policies
### Late Policy

### Honor Code

### Grading


#### Course Components

- **Attendance and Participation (10%)**: This primarily includes coming to class prepared (i.e., completed any preparatory readings/assignments before our scheduled course meeting), engaging with peers on course content (i.e., asking questions, sharing thoughts and ideas, participating in group activities).

- **Weekly Assignments (60%)**: Each week offers the opportunity to discuss and apply different forms of environmental justice, through the lens of a community case study. 
    - Tuesdays will begin with small and large-group discussions on one theoretical piece and one community case study. Please come ready to discuss the case study and apply theoretical findings.
    - Fridays will be spent primarily on an in-class data visualization exercise related to the weekly case study. Please review the exercise before class, and be ready to work in rotating pairs on the assignment, and submit it individually by the following Monday at 11:59 PM. Note that the assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped (i.e., 6 of 7 assignments, each counting for 10% of your grade).  
- **Community Case Study Final Project (30%)**: End of semester individual project on a community case study of your choice. Note that final project score is cumulative, including a mid-semester check-in and proposed data visualization strategy (10%) and final submission (20%).
