## Goals and Expectations
### Course Description
In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach** (i.e., race, ethnicity,  gender, sexuality, class, and disability) and their applications to environmental injustice.
2. **Assess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities** related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus). 
3. **Identify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice** (procedural, recognitional, and restorative justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.


## Course Community
#### What I Want You to Know About Me
1. **I Care about Meaningful Teaching and Learning Experiences**
I also graduated from a Seven Sisters college, and found it to be the most transformative experience of my life. I loved the small class sizes, relationships that I built with professors, and the opportunity to learn in creative, different ways. Because of this, I hope that students not only take away the skills associated with the course's measurable outcomes, but also learn more about themselves, their peers, and the environment around them. This requires a certain level of vulnerability and trust, which I hope that we can establish together. 

Ultimately, I designed this course around three pedogogical commitments:
- *Democratic Education:* Promote a learning community that (cite Friere, Pedagogy of Heart).
- *Pluralist Learning:* Engage with, relate to, and communicate with individuals and communities (Simmer-Brown, )
- *Loving Corrections* (cite amb, 2024)

#### I want you to stop by Office Hours (E152)

#### I get Overwhelmed by the Climate Crisis, too

### Grading
**Course Components:**
- Attendance and Participation: 
- Weekly assignments: Each week offers the opportunity to discuss and apply different forms of environmental justice, through the lens of a community case study. 
    - Tuesdays will begin with small and large-group discussions on one theoretical piece and one community case study. Please come ready to discuss the case study and apply theoretical findings.
    - Fridays will be spent primarily on an in-class data visualization exercise related to the weekly case study. Please review the exercise before class, and be ready to work in rotating pairs on the assignment. 
- Community Case Study Final Project: End of semester individual project on a community case study of your choice. Note that final project score is cumulative, including a mid-semester check-in and proposed data visualization strategy (10%) and final submission (20%).

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:
