## Course Description
In this interdisciplinary course, students are asked to engage with environmental justice — a social movement and form of inquiry intended to rectify the inequitable distribution of environmental benefit and burden — both theoretically and methodologically. Students will examine five forms of justice: distributional, recognitional, procedural, restorative, and cosmopolitan, and be invited to apply them to weekly community-level case studies. Using a combination of theory and introductory data visualization skills, we will learn from past injustices, explore present interventions, and imagine more equitable realities.

## 
1. **Demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach** (i.e., race, ethnicity,  gender, sexuality, class, and disability) and their applications to environmental injustice.
2. **Assess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities** related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus). 
3. **Identify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice** (procedural, recognitional, and restorative justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.

### Teaching, Learning, and Being in Community

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with [Duke's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion](https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion).

Announcements will be emailed through Sakai Announcements periodically. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.

## Activities & Assessment

### Weekly Theory Discussions

Each week offers the opportunity to discuss and apply different forms of environmental justice, through the lens of a community case study. Tuesdays will begin with small and large-group discussions on one theoretical piece and one community case study. Please come ready to discuss the case study and apply theoretical findings.

### Weekly Data Application Assignments

Fridays will be spent primarily on an in-class data visualization exercise related to the weekly case study. Please review the exercise before class, and be ready to work in pairs on a 

### Self-Reflection

There will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course thus far.

### Final Project

The purpose of the [final project](/project/) is to apply what you've learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

<center>

## Course policies

### Academic honesty

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

### Late work & extensions

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.
