## About This Course
::: columns

::: {.column style="width: 50%; font-size: 70%;"}
- Traditional take on Environmental Justice tends to focus on *Distributional* and *Recognitional* Justice
- My take on Environmental Justice: 
  - Expansive movement that welcomes everyone into belonging
  - Community-based
  - Solutions-focused
  - Expands ideas of justice to include both theory and methods

## Learning Outcomes{.smaller}

1. **Demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an intersectional approach** (i.e., how systems of power can reinforce oppression of land and people) and their applications to environmental injustice.
2. **Reflect on how your positionality and lived experiences** shape your approach to environmental justice. 
3. **Assess empirical patterns of environmental injustice in US communities** related to Food, Energy, and Water (FEW nexus). 
4. **Identify opportunities and challenges beyond distributional justice** (procedural, recognitional, restorative, and cosmopolitan justice) for environmental solutions spatially and temporally.
