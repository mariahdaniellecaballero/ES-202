## My Pedogogical Goals{.smaller}
- **Reflect on your own identity** and how it relates to EJ-related research and action.
- Build a course community that **recognizes and values** one another's strengths.
- Learn applicable **interdisciplinary skills to research and advocate for** EJ-related challenges
  - Individual homework and group final project
  - All assignments are <= 10% 
  - I want our classroom to be a safe, kind, and generative space!

## A Note on My First Semester 
- New course + new institution = **lots** of learning
- Will likely ask for more feedback than other professors 
- Syllabus is complete, but may make small changes along the way as I receive feedback

## The Wellesley Student
- What are some aspects of your favorite courses/approaches to learning?
- What responsibilities are you all juggling? 
- Anything else I should know about teaching at Wellesley? 

## Housekeeping
- Office Hours
- Centering Activity?
- Accessing Course Website
- Set Shared Expectations

## Office Hours
- Currently, I have appointment slots for:
  - T/F: 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM
  - W: 2-4 PM
- Any scheduling challenges I should be aware of? 

## Centering Activity (optional){.smaller}
- Life is busy, and we often have millions of things on our minds
- Centering activities are brief activities (< 5 minutes) meant to bring everyone into the present
- A student would be in charge of leading before each class 
- This could be...
  - A breathing exercise
  - A silly doodle
  - A journaling activity
  - Reading your favorite poem
  - Sharing your favorite new song
- Are we into this?

## Course Website

## Schedule
You can access the weekly schedule on the course website.

## Setting Shared Expectations{.smaller} 
- How do we want to be accountable to one another? 
- This could mean agreeing to...
  - Not use phones within a course session
  - Assuming best intentions from peers
  - Engaging in class conversation
  - Listening to and respecting others' perspectives  

<span style="color:red;">Take 5 minutes with a partner to discuss, be ready to share at least one! </span>

## For Friday
- Check course website for readings 
- Preview first assignment and come prepared with questions
