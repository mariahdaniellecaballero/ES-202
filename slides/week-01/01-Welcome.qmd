## My Pedogogical Goals{.smaller}
- **Reflect on your own identity** and how it relates to EJ-related research and action.
- Build a course community that **recognizes and values** one another's strengths.
- Learn applicable **interdisciplinary skills to research and advocate for** EJ-related challenges
  - Individual homework and group final project
  - All assignments are <= 10% 
  - I want our classroom to be a safe, kind, and generative space!

## Housekeeping

## Office Hours 
- Optimized based on ES 202/206 student schedules, every student should be available for at least one of the following slots:
- Currently: 
  - Mon, 12-2 PM
  - Wed, 2-3:30 PM
  - Thurs, 4-5:15 PM

## Centering Activity (optional){.smaller}
- Life is busy, and we often have millions of things on our minds
- Centering activities are brief activities (< 5 minutes) meant to bring everyone into the present
- A student would be in charge of leading before each class 
- This could be...
  - A breathing exercise
  - A silly doodle
  - A journaling activity
  - Reading your favorite poem
  - Sharing your favorite new song
- Are we into this?

## Generative AI Policy{.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Data centers use *overwhelming* amounts of energy and water to answer queries.
- It also poses significant threats to the learning outcomes of this class.
- Therefore, **I ask that you do not use it** for the following:
  - Summarizing or annoting readings
  - Generating code of any kind
  - Answering any questions on assignments

## Late Policy{.smaller}
- Each student has **3 24-hour late passes**
- Can use multiple passes on one assignment deadline. 
- Work is not accepted after final exam period. 
- Passes are not transferable, resuable, or divisible. 
- After your late pass budget is exhausted, each additional 24-hour delay in assignment results in a 10% grade deduction.
- To use a late day, fill out the Google form in the Syllabus *before* the assignment deadline.


## For Monday
- Check course website for readings 
- Note on snow: 
  - Class may be via Zoom, depending on conditions. Will let everyone know likely by Sunday evening.
