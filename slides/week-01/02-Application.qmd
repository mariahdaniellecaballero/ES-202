## What we Read {.smaller}
- Holmes, A. G. D. (2020). [Researcher Positionality- A Consideration of Its Influence and Place in Qualitative Research - A New Researcher Guide](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/sites/default/files/2024/09/holmes_2020.pdf). 8(4) 1-10. 

- Di Chiro, G. (2020). [Mobilizing 'intersectionality' in environmental justice research and action in a time of crisis](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/well/reader.action?docID=6228917&ppg=463&c=RVBVQg). Environmental justice, 316-333    

## Warm-up
- In what contexts have your heard the term intersectional used?

## Terms to Define {.smaller}
- Using the Di Chiro (2020) article, each team will define one cluster of terms...
  - Intersectionality 
    - systems of oppression
    - matrix of domination
  - Multiplicity
    - Additive categories
  - Environmental Justice
    - Decolonial
    - Multi-species
  - Commons
    - Collective care
    - multi-scalar

## Mapping it out
::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- One teammate- tape your system to the board, draw connections/words/doodles as needed
- Another teammate- explain your system to the class
- As a class: Tell me how they connect to one another

## EJ + Intersectionality
- Value of multiplicative over additive approach? 
- Can we begin to see how an intersectional approach can help build more meaningful movements?

## Intersectionality + Positionality
- Fixed versus fluid aspects of positionality? 
- How will this impact how we approach this course? 

## Positionality Assignment
- Are we begining to see how positionality will influence how you engage with this course? 
- Do we see opportunities for an intersectional approach this semester? 
- Questions on HW 01?

## Creating Shared Expectations
- How do we want to be accountable to one another? 
- This could mean agreeing to...
  - Not use devices on Tuesdays 
  - Assuming best intentions from peers
  - Engaging in class conversation
  - Listening to and respecting others' perspectives  

## For Next Class
- Two readings on EJ + Distributional Justice
- Julia leading centering activity :-)
- Positionality Statement due Thursday (September 11, 2025) at 11:59 PM on Brightspace.
