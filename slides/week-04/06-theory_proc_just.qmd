## Evolution of Procedural Justice
- 1960s to early 2000s: Focus on distributional justice
- Early 2000s: Growing focus on procedural justice 
 - *"procedural justice is a key condition for distributive environmental justice"* (Schlosburg, 2007, ppp 51)

## Interconnectedness of Procedural Justice{.smaller}

## Conceptions of Procedural Environmental Justice {.smaller}
- **Equality:** Power is shared equally among potential participants in decision-making process
  - **Proportionality:** power in environmental decisionmaking should be distributed *in proportion* to their stake in the outcome. 
  - **Plurality:** Everyone potentially affected by the outcome should be included in decision-making process *as an equal*.

## Hunold and Young's Forms of Procedural Justice {.smaller}
![](./images/five_proc_just.png)

## Five Principles in Praxis 
- **Continuum**
  - Inclusiveness
  - Consultation over time
  - Design of Decision-making Procedures
- **All or nothing**
  - Shared decision-making authority
  - Authoritative decision-making

## Studying Procedural Justice
- Ethnography/participant observation
- Power-mapping
- Comparison to theoretical framework

## Scale + Procedural Justice
- What are the challenges of each form of procedural environmental justice at different scales? 
- Which of the five principles are likely most difficult to uphold in practice?
- Are there examples of institutions making strides toward procedural environmental justice? 

## Overview of Bracero Program

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
- **Bracero** translates to "strong arm"
- **1942: Public Law 45** EO establishes a bi-lateral agreement between Mexico and the U.S. for short-term farm labor
    - Mexican Revolution destabilized Mexico’s economy, WWII created a labor shortage in the U.S.
- **1951: Public Law 78** passed to extend, formalize, and decentralize the Bracero Program, and include additional protections.
  - Agreement promised fair wages, steady employment, free housing, insurance, and transportation home.
- **Program ended in 1964**, after admitting over **5 million** temporary workers across **24 states**

## Procedural Injustices of the Bracero Program 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
- Federally-sanctioned process that created temporary contracts for Mexican nationals 
  - YVFVFLC acts as a middleman for acquiring laborers, overseeing housing conditions and contracts. 
  - Nearest consolate is in Portland, OR (180 miles)
  - Crops in the Yakima Valley tend to be labor-intensive, created a **strong** dependence on short-term laborers for decades. 
  - Reinforces power imbalances for generations.

## Applying Five Principles of Procedural Justice {.smaller}
- In pairs, apply Hunold & Young's principles of Procedural Justice to Gamboa's Reading

## Why this Matters Today
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
- This program lives on with a different name.
  - H-2A program offers short-term visas for workers to travel to the US for agricultural labor. 
  - Created in 1986, H-2A visas have increased over 7000-fold -- 315,328 in 2024. 
  - Provisions for housing, travel, and prevailing wages.

## Discussion
- How do we consider time as it relates to procedural environmental justice? 
- What sorts of processes exist to make these programs more procedurally just? 
- What methods might we use to reveal procedural/distributional/recognitional injustice?
