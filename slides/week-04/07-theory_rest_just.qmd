- Oral history of Rural Electrification

## Origins of Restorative Justice
- Rooted in criminal justice
  - Focus on repairing harm by addressing needs of victims, and holding offenders responsible for repairing damages 
- Ultimate goal is to restore victim/community to a place before harm was inflicted.

## Restorative Justice + Energy {.smaller}
- How injustice can be repaired and/or returned to its previous state
  - For energy: Prioritizing communities that have born disproportionate burden due to historic policies and practices.

## Intro to Community Case Study{.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Focus on Electrification in Rural North Carolina
- How restorative injustice has shaped energy landscapes
  - Harrison piece on state-sanctioned redlining (but for electricity)-- example of how data can be for *injustice*, too. 
  - Interview about NC rural cooperatives as firsthand account

## Rural Electrification as a Policy {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- **US in 1936:** Rural Electrification Act, EO passed by FDR to designate funds to create rural electric co-operatives.
- **NC in 1930s:** Governor creates rural electrification committee to plan how rural electricity should be installed.
  - 1934 Rural electrification survey issued, to *estimate electricity use*, *plan line distribution*, and *project profitability*

## Harrison Piece {.smaller}
- Digitized 1934 surveys for Edgecombe County
  - Rural electrification planning is an example of how race, space, and energy resulted in marginalization of Black farming communities
  - Demonstratees how power can be used to "assign, calculate, and rationalize the differential value assigned at the level of the population" (pp. 912)

## Correction Factor {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- 26 data points for each home, only two subjective values:
  - Surveyors asked to grade "Condition of the house [A, B, C, D]" and "Authoritativeness of the interview [A, B, C, D]"
  - Combined with race and land tenure to create correction factor 
- Correction factor was multipled by projected electricity use to underestimate energy use.

## Restorative (in)justice {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- How is Edgecombe County a prime example of restorative injustice?
  - In the 1930s, how did marginalized electricity access impact daily life?
  - What lasting impacts/harm can be understood through uneven energy development proposed in Edgecombe?
  - What might restorative justice look like for rural communities of color in the South today?

## Rural Cooperatives{.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- 1936- REA gave federal funds to rural communities to start their own electric companies (rural cooperatives)
  - co-ops are nonprofits, and governed by a member-elected board. 
- Edgecombe and Martin counties were the first REA-funded cooperative in the state
-  Ultimately, it's hard to know if the 1934 rural electrification survey *actually* drove line buildout in Edgecombe, or if other states/cooperatives used the survey for their communities. 
- How can this serve as a cautionary tale for "objective" data in decisionmaking?

## Alvin Morrison's Oral History
- Black farmer in Iredell County, born in 1910
  - Wealthy farmers in his community wer originally approached by Duke electric to power certain homes, and they refused. 
  - After a cooperative was formed, Alvin + another Black farmer worked to sign up other members. 
  - Describes how electricity changed his home and farm for the better. 

## Rural cooperatives 
- How does Alvin's oral history contrast the goals of the rural electrification survey? 
- Are rural cooperatives an example of collective care? 
- How does collective care connect to the three forms of justice we've discussed thus far?
- What discriminatory policies of the past could be reimagined with collective care in mind? 
  - Redlining + housing? Farmworker policies + food? 

## Leaving you all with a Quote
"Take a plant, a flower or anything. Your water, your light, the elements in the soil...*they have to work cooperatively to produce them*. That's just a basic concept that I have tried to follow throughout my life... And this rural cooperative movement I think confirms what I have believeed personally for a long, long time-- that, to succeed, *if you can get a group of people working together cooperatively, you can almost achieve whatever you desire*." -- Alvin Morrison, 1984
