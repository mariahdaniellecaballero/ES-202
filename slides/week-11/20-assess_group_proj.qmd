## Overview
- Centering Activity
- Reviewing Logic Models (mini-lecture)
- Paired Work

## Centering Activity {.smaller}
- Tell me the highlight of your day (or week)!

## Reviewing Logic Models {.smaller}
- Logic models are helpful for *designing, implementing, and evaluating* program activities. 
  - Process is intended to be iterative, especially as goals/contexts/priorities change.
  - Specific outcomes are important-- rather than "less asthma": 
    - 25% reduction in childhood asthma hospitalizations
    - Improved air quality in 300 public schools
    - State and local policies passed to reduce environmental triggers such as anti-idling regulations for school buses
