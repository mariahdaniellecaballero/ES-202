## Recognitional Justice in Tradition {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
- Rather than just looking for violations of *sameness* (i.e., distribution and procedure) we should also consider violations of *difference*. 
- Recognition is rooted in Indigenous values, specifically the Haudenosaunee [HO-din-oh-SHOH-nee] alliance. 
  - Kaswentha treaty belt represents two societies as vessels (birch bark canoe + ship), sharing the same river. 
- Anishinaabe [ah-nish-uh-NAH-bay] belief that all beings of creation have a spirit and are beholden to one another for continuation of Creation

# Recognitional injustice in Theory {.smaller}
- Fraser (1998) writes that misrecognition can occur via three processes: 
  - **Cultural Domination:** Social norms of more powerful groups are imposed on those less powerful. 
  - **Non-Recognition:** Failing to achnowledge or engage with marginalized individuals, resulting in loss of invaluable knowledge
  - **Disrespect:** Exercise of power through condescension/patronization of marginalized groups 
- Figueroa (2006) defines misrecognition as rooted in environmental identity + heritage.

## History of Isle de Jean Charles {.smaller}
- **1830:** Indian Removal Act, forced removal of Native Americans east of the Mississippi for white settlement and plantation expansion (double violence of Native people and enslaved Africans)
  - Choctaw, Chitimacha, Biloxi, and Houma Tribes fled to Bayous and lived peacefully for ~90 years. 
- **1920:** Oil drilling arrives
  - 50,000+ oil wells drilled, 10,000 miles of pipelines
  - Pockets of air = subsidence, canals = salt water intrusion
- **Present:** Sea level rise, increasing storms, continued oil drilling
  - Choctaw still not federally recognized tribe


## Map of Isle de Jean Charles {.smaller}
- Highest land loss rate in the US: 
  - If we applied the same rate to NY, "Central Park would disappear in a month. Manhattan would vanish within a year and a half. The last of Brooklyn would dissolve four years later". - Rich, 2014

## Memory of Isle de Jean Charles {.smaller}
"Imagine a vast, green island. Hundreds of people living peacefully in log-and-clay houses under palmetto-thatched roofs. Gardens lush with watermelons, cantaloupe, and cucumbers, fruit trees with figs, peaches, pecans and persimmons. All of it now gone. Chickens and pigs wandering the gardens. Fat cattle grazing the water lands. Meadows of marigold and matrimony vine. Gone. In spring, the marshes loud with blue-winged teal and snow geese, the bayous teeming with shrimp and oysters, beavers and muskrat ‚Äî gone". 
-McClintock, 2020

## Leaving you all with a Quote
"In losing Isle de Jean Charles, the world is not just losing an island with an irreplaceable community. We are losing a lifeway. An Indigenous ethic of intimate relations between people, and between people and land; an ethic of being beholden ‚Äî of holding others and knowing one will, in turn, be held." 
- McClintock, 2020
