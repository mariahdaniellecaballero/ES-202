## Cosmopolitan Justice in Theory{.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Most recent tenant in EJ scholarship (~2023)
- Cosmopolitan justice dates back to Immanuel Kant's ideas of Stoics and Cynics (18th Century)

## Forms of Cosmopolitan Justice {.smaller}
![Skillington 2020](images/forms_cosmo.png)


## Cosmopolitan + Distributive Justice {.smaller}
- Distribution should not be constrained by borders, but should be equitable across the globe
  - If all individuals have moral value, shared across all of humanity, we are all morally bound to one another, regardless of citizenship. 
- But how do we redress climate change implications at a global level? 

## Cosmopolitan + Procedural Justice {.smaller}
- Procedurally, democratic processes should address disconnect that may exist between decisionmaking processes and those affected.
  - How do we create transnational governance structures, and do decisions supercede local decisions? 

## Intro to community case study {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Welcome to COP27! 
- November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt 
- 46,000 delegates from all over the world
- Major Policy Tracks: 
  - Loss and Damage Fund for impacted nations, largely funded by EU + other high emitters.
  - Climate finance for adaptation
  - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets 
  - Fossil fuel phaseout

## Climate Negotiations {.smaller}
- Each country sends delegates to negotiate on their behalf
  - 16,000 delegates (largest was UAE with 1070 delegates, smallest was 1 delegate)
- Observers can also attend (with badges)
  - 11,700 NGO members
  - 2,200 Other agencies/businesses 
  - 3,300 media 
- Negotiations last 2 weeks 

## Focus on Small Island States {.smaller}
- Excellent example of cosmopolitan, distributive, and procedural injustice. 
- Small island states' Coalition approach has made significant changes in global climate policy. 
- Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) considered the "conscience of the negotiations"

## AOSIS Anthem {.smaller}

## Challenges for AOSIS {.smaller}
- Less resources, fewer delegates
- 11,969 delegates, ranging from 0 to 92 per state
  - Delegates often from NGOs, universities, or private sector
- Breadth in size, landscapes, climate challenges, and interests
- Variation in language proficiency on technical subjects

## Skillington's Proposal for Global Cosmopolitan Distributive Justice {.smaller}
"First, at a transnational level where a confederation of high polluting states *acknowledges its historical responsibilities for inflicting hardships on others*, as well as the ongoing capabilities of its members to address these harms and offer assistance to its primary victims. Second at the global level where a new global resource tax regime could be introduced to *accumulate revenues from high polluters around the world and redistribute funds* among those adversely affected by the effects of deteriorating climate conditions" (pp. 52)

## AOSIS + Cosmopolitan Justice {.smaller}
- Is the loss and damage fund an attempt at cosmopolitan distributive justice? 
  - What's missing from COP negotiations for legal, moral, political and/or cultural cosmopolitanism?
- Other governance structures for climate change and cosmopolitanism? 

## Logistics 
- Samantha leading centering activity :-)
- Focus on more plots + EDA using COP2022 delegate data! 
- [optional] Read R4DS Chapters 10 + 11
