- Group Discussion + Debrief

## Centering Activity

- Gwen :-) 

## What We Read {.smaller}
- Powell, D.E., (2018). Interlude 3: Off-Grid in the Chuskas (pp.230-235). In Landscapes of Power: Politics of Energy in the Navajo Nation (pp. 187‚Äì235). Duke University Press. https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1220jnq.11
- Pasqualetti, M. J., Jones, T. E., Necefer, L., Scott, C. A., & Colombi, B. J. (2016). A paradox of plenty: Renewable energy on Navajo Nation Lands. Society & Natural Resources, 29(8), 885-899.

## Recalling Recognition Justice{.smaller}
- Misrecognition can occur via three processes:
 ![alt](images/recognition.png)
 - Figueroa (2006) defines misrecognition as rooted in environmental identity + heritage.

## Whyte's Recognition Paradigm{.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
- "Paradigm" refers to a criterion that can be used to identify whether an unjust process is occurring. 
  - Distributional paradigm
  - Procedural paradigm
  - Recognition paradigm
- Examples of each?

## Intro to Community Case Study {.smaller}
- Example of all five EJ tenets
- Pasqualetti, et al. (2016) asks, **why hasn't more RE been developed on Tribal lands, specifically in Navajo Nation**? 
  - Relationship to extractive energy development 
  - Spiritual and social values
  - Energy governance

## Navajo Nation {.smaller}
- Din√© translates to "the people"
- Located in three corners: Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico
- Biggest Tribe in terms of: 
  - Area: Size of Ireland (2.5x state of Massachusetts)
  - Population: 300,000+ members
- Young population, high unemployment rates (48.5%, 11x national average), and low household income ($8,250 annually, 10% of national average).
- Complex history of coal and uranium mining

## Energy Extractivism on Navajo Lands {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Highest value of economic activity for decades has been fossil fuel/mining.
- Long history of Navajo Nation fighting for control of their land's mineral resources. 
  - Coal slurry (mix of coal + water shipped to NV, hugely depleting groundwater)
  - Subbituminous coal mining (Significant air pollution)
  - Uranium mining and milling (environmental health risks)

## Solar Paradox of Plenty {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Navajo Nation solar potential is **100x the installed capacity of California**.
  - Navajo Nation wasn't included in REA of 1935.
  - Roughly 1/3 of Navajo Nation homes don't have electricity today. 
  - Matrilineal spiritual + ancestral grazing lands are very remote.

## Spiritual Ties {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- *K'√©* is Navajo word for kinship, applies to human and non-human relationships.
- *H√≥zh√≥* focuses on environmental preservation. 
  - Navajo people are likely to place more importance on future costs to the environment than promise of employment/economic benefit.

## Energy Governance {.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Tribal Lands are a mix of *Public, Tribal Trust, Tribal Fee, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Private, State (3 states), and BIA Indian Allotments*
  - This makes governance very challenging. 
  - Some Federal processes and policies apply to Tribal lands
  - States have little authority over Tribal lands
  - Navajo Nation Codes regulate RE development, 110 chapter governments often have final say via approval rights

## Solar in Navajo Nation {.smaller}
- Do any forms of **misrecognition** (cultural domination, non-recognition, disrespect) apply to Pasqualetti's piece? 
- Do any of the other four tenets apply to this case study?
- How does scale factor in to EJ implications of solar (i.e., distributed, community, utility-scale)?

## Off-Grid in the Chuskas{.smaller}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
- Short piece in "Landscapes of Power"
  - Powell stays off-grid in Hogan with Adella Begaye
  - Details Angie + Jay's experience as seasonal sheep + goat herders
- Describes heterogeneity in NN lives; energy preferences for independence, environmental heritages and livelihoods, modernity versus tradition

## Processes for Solar + Recognition Justice? {.smaller}
- What aspects of decisionmaking should be prioritized for the Navajo Nation's energy transition? 
  - Energy legacies
  - Environmental heritage
  - Governance
  - Self-Determination
- If we were part of a community organization to increase solar uptake among NN households, what might our logic model look like (inputs, activities, outcomes)? 


## Friday Logistics
- Mid-semester evaluation due Wednesday (Oct 22)
- Project Proposal is Due Friday (Oct 24)
- Last Community Case Study on Solar Potential and energy burden
- Simmie leading centering activity :-)
