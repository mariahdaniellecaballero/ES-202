## What we Read {.smaller}

## Procedural Justice
- Considers unequal share of authority, power and influence, and how they impact environmental decision-making 
- Distributional injustice can be an outcome of procedural injustice, and vice versa.
- Recognition justice is also a key component of procedural justice.

## Conceptions of Procedural Environmental Justice {.smaller}
- **Equality:** Power is shared equally among potential participants in decision-making process
  - **Proportionality:** power in environmental decisionmaking should be distributed *in proportion* to their stake in the outcome. 
  - **Plurality:** Everyone potentially affected by the outcome should be included in decision-making process *as an equal*.
