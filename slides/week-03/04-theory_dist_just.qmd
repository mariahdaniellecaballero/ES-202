- Five minute free write
- Setting Class Expectations
- Introduction to Theory and Case Study
  - Discussion

## Centering 
- Dr. Caballero :-)

## Five minute free write 
- Biggest takeaways from the readings 
  - Questions you still have 
  - Things you disagree with 
  - Newer ways of looking at things
  - Chosen case study

## Setting Shared Expectations
- How do we want to be accountable to one another? 
- This could mean agreeing to...
  - Not use devices on Mondays 
  - Assuming best intentions from peers
  - Engaging in class conversation
  - Listening to and respecting others' perspectives

# Distributional Justice
- Three dominant theories:
  - utilitarianism
  - equality
  - capabilities

# Utilitarianism
- "Most good for the most people"
- Can justify poor conditions for few, if it means much better conditions for many. 
- Utilitarians do not ignore that inequality is relative.
  - Providing resources to low-income families more impactful than rich ones -> greater impact on overall social welfare. 

# Equality
- Based in Rawl's concept, "Veil of Ignorance"
  - If we didn't know our own identity, and asked what kind of distribution would be most fair, we would choose equality as a foundation. 
  - "No one should be subject to more harm than others"

## But what if the world is unequal?{.smaller}
- Bases for deviating from strict equality

## Minimum Capabilities
- Rather than comparing the burden that people bear, maybe we focus on what people need to lead a meaningful life (Sen, 2009). 
- Includes physical wellbeing and ability to make choices.
- Can align well with legal approach to environmental protection (right to basic free will and wellbeing).

## Discussion
- What do we gain (and lose) by comparing experiences of distributional burden? 
- Preference for comparative versus minimum capabilities framing? 
- Who is involved in creating distributional injustice, and how to we measure/avoid/repair distributionally unjust outcomes? 

# Intro to Community Case Study
- Fantastic case of distributional justice. 
- Uses data to legitimize lived experience.
- Seminal study that influenced national SOE report, POC summit, and Environmental Justice Executive Order.

## Solid Waste Siting in 1983, Houston, TX
- USEPA created in 1970 
- Love Canal discovered in 1977
- Resource Conservation and Recovery Act passed in 1976
  - Bullard's study considers different types of incinerators and landfill sites sited between 1920 to present. 
    - Considers neighborhood composition and proximity to schools. 

## Methods
- Interviews with personnel from Houston's Solid Waste Management Division
- Active permits 
- US Census Statistics 

## Findings 
- Black residents more likely to live near solid waste sites than white counterparts. 
  - Unjust process took place over 50+ years
  - Local government paved the way for private industries to continue unjust patterns. 
  - Disproportionate percentage of sites located near students with predominantly Black students. 

## Why it Matters Today

## Discussion 
- Are there aspects of Bullard's work that still feel pertinent to today's EJ challenges? 
  - What's changed? 
- What can we learn from Bullard's work, and how might we improve on it? 

## Tying it Together 
- How does distributional justice apply to this case? 
  - Who are key stakeholders in Houston, and how are they operationalizing decisions that lead to unjust outcomes? 
- Would Dr. Bullard consider his findings as ditributional injustice? 
- Are we missing anything by only considering distributional injustice? 

## For Thursday: 
  - Case study coding using Bullard's data :-)
