## Mid-point Reflection 
- Up until this point we've:

  - Learned five tenets of justice, and considered them in theory and in praxis using different communities as case studies
  - Learned introductory skills in data science and visualization
  - Applied EJ methods and theory to topics of waste, food, water, climate, and energy throughout time and space

## Looking Ahead
- **Tuesdays:**
  - 5 speakers across FEW + Climate nexus
  - Representing advocacy and community organizing, academia, and local government. 
  - Mix of education/disciplinary backgrounds, some Wellesley alum! 
  - Sign-up list for speaker engagement: Opportunity for class participation
- **Fridays:** 
  - In-class time to work on final projects


## Mid-Semester Evaluation
- Will email out to class, want to collect feedback about how the first half went, and where we're headed. 
  - Due Wednesday, October 22, 2025 at 11:59 PM [Class participation credit]

## Logistics
- Class starts at 9:55, please do your very best to make it on time! 
  - In addition to my time, I really care about our guest speakers, and I want to ensure we can get through our centering activity AND start our Zoom sessions at 10 AM sharp. 
- Alden is joining class on Tuesday as an observer. 
  - Thoughts on where he should sit?
