# EJ over Time

## Origins of EJ {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Term "environmental justice" was popularized in 1980s
- **1982:** Began as a social movement
  - Communities of color organizing and resisting unfair siting activities (toxic waste, landfills, and oil refineries)
  - Protests in Warren County, NC are especially salient to origins of EJ
- **1987:** United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice published report on Black and Latine exposure to toxic sites. 
- **1991:** UCC hosted the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, where the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice were created.

## 17 Principles of EJ + Tenet-Based Approach
- 17 Principles are still highly regarded
-  Today, a lot of academic conversations around what EJ means to whom, and how to classify it.
- I chose a five tenet approach (currently used a lot in Energy Justice scholarship), because it provides a nice framework for theorizing different aspects of justice, *while still staying true to the EJ imaginaries of POC Env. Leadership summit*

## Principles + Tenet Sorting
<span style="color:red;"> In groups of 4: Sort the 17 Principles of EJ into the five tenets, be ready to discuss! </span> 

## Sorting Results
- Defining Environmental Justice is tricky, and many definitions/approaches will overlap. 
  - This can be both a strength and a challenge. 
  - If I could make this class 34 weeks long, I would!
 

## Origins of EJ 
- Any other reactions, thoughts, or things you'd like to discuss from the Murdock piece (history of EJ)? 

# Distributional Justice
- Three dominant theories:
  - utilitarianism
  - equality
  - capabilities

# Utilitarianism
- "Most good for the most people"
- Can justify poor conditions for few, if it means much better conditions for many. 
- Utilitarians do not ignore that inequality is relative.
  - Providing resources to low-income families more impactful than rich ones -> greater impact on overall social welfare. 

# Equality
- Based in Rawl's concept, "Veil of Ignorance"
  - If we didn't know our own identity, and asked what kind of distribution would be most fair, we would choose equality as a foundation. 
  - "No one should be subject to more harm than others"

## But what if the world is unequal?{.smaller}
- Bases for deviating from strict equality
![](./images/deviating_from_equality.png)


## Minimum Capabilities
- Rather than comparing the burden that people bear, maybe we focus on what people need to lead a meaningful life (Sen, 2009). 
- Includes physical wellbeing and ability to make choices.
- Can align well with legal approach to environmental protection (right to basic free will and wellbeing).

## Thoughts on Distributional Justice?
- Utilitarianism
- Equality
- Capabilities

# Intro to Community Case Study

## Theoretical Applications 
- Fantastic case of distributional justice. 
- Uses data to legitimize lived experience.
- Seminal study that influenced national SOE report, POC summit, and Environmental Justice Executive Order. 

## What we'll be doing
- Intro to R and what it can do 
- Recreating Bullard's tables, creating our own. 
- Making one plot 
- Connecting to theory

# Logistics
For Friday: 

- Clara leading centering activity. :-)
- Read community case study in schedule
- Review Chapter 1 of RFDS [optional]
- Make sure posit login is working!
