# What is EJ? 

## What we know
- <span style="color:red;"> In groups of 4: draft your definition of Environmental Justice, be ready to share! </span>

## Similarities/Differences in definitions?

## Origins of EJ {.smaller}
- Term "environmental justice" was popularized in 1980s
- **1982:** Began as a social movement
  - Communities of color organizing and resisting unfair siting activities (toxic waste, landfills, and oil refineries)
  - Protests in Warren County, NC are especially salient to EJ movement
- **1987:** United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice published report on Black and Latine exposure to toxic sites. 
- **1991:** UCC hosted the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, where the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice were created

## 17 Principles of EJ + Tenet-Based Approach
- 17 Principles are still highly regarded
-  A lot of academic conversations around what EJ means to whom, and how to classify it.
  - lmk if you want more readings suggestions on this
- I chose a five tenet approach (currently used a lot in Energy Justice scholarship), because I think it provides a nice framework for theorizing different aspects of justice.

## Principles + Tenet Sorting
- <span style="color:red;"> In groups of 4: Sort the 17 Principles of EJ into the five tenets, be ready to discuss! </span> 

## Sorting Results
- Defining Environmental Justice is tricky, and many definitions/approaches will overlap. 
  - This can be both a strength and a challenge. 
  - (If I could make this course 34 weeks long, I would!)
